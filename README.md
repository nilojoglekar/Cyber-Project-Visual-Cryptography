# Cyber-Project-Visual-Cryptography
The aim of this project is to encrypt images appropriately in social media. As 
social media is a vast platform, millions of users share their images online and the content is 
often not secured resulting in large risk of cyber abuse and misuse. This can also be applied 
in banks and military bases, where sensitive information is transferred and encryption if data 
is necessary.
